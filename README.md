# CS361 - Operating Systems

# Labs
- [Lab 1](https://github.com/calemon/cs361/tree/master/lab1)
  - Three operations are commonly used to program CPU and I/O registers: Test, Set, and Clear. Lab 1 will implement these 3 operations along with a Mask function.
- [Lab 2](https://github.com/calemon/cs361/tree/master/lab2)
  - You will be creating a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) driver for MZOS (Marz OS). The point of this lab is to learn how to control hardware from an operating system. The programming part requires no more knowledge than pointers and pointer arithmetic.
- [Lab 3](https://github.com/calemon/cs361/tree/master/lab3)
  - You will be implementing the interactive scheduler for Marz OS. You will be writing three different interactive scheduling algorithms: round robin, multilevel, and multilevel feedback.
